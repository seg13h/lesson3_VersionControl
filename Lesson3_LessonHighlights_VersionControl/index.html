            </h2>
            <p class="lead">It all started with a man named Linus Torvalds.  Linus Torvalds created Linux, which led to the Linux kernel, a large open software project. The maintenance to this project was done in a mess of patches and archived files until the project started using BitKeeper. Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end and the relationship between Linux and BitKeeper went south. This forced the Linux developers to create their own new system. Aiming for a faster, simpler, and stronger design, Git was created in 2005 with a strong branching system and an ease of use and efficiency like no other.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git operates very differently from other systems.  Other systems store data as sets of files that are recorded as changes are made.  Git stores data as a set of snapshots; every time a project is saved, it takes a picture of your files and stores those instead of the entire project every time you save and doesn’t re-save a new file if no changes have been made.  It is more efficient because Git only uses local resources to function without requiring information from other computers.  Other systems need information from other computers in a web of networks, which slows the progression of projects.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Repositories</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are two methods to obtaining a Git repository.  The first is pulling an existing project into Git.  The second way is to copy a repository that already exists in another server. To pull an existing project, you use the project’s type to determine the commands to accomplish the transition into Git.  To clone an existing Git repository, there is a different set of commands that allow you to contribute to the project.  The data is then pulled to your newly created Git to be edited as your own project. There are various protocols to transfer Git to servers to access different repositories.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Changes Made in Repositories</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">After establishing a Git repository, its time to make the changes you want and save those changes, which creates the snapshots in the Git files as earlier mentioned.  Your files can fall into two different categories – tracked or untracked. Tracked files only contain files in the most recent snapshot, whether they have been modified or not. Untracked files are all the files that most recent snapshot. Git starts to classify the files you edit as “modified” and they become tracked files. The “git status” command is used to then determine which files are in which state. Directly after cloning, this command will leave the user without tracked or modified files.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Committing Git Changes</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Any files that have recently been created or changed that have not been run with the “git add” command are unstaged. When the staging area is prepared the way the user wants it, the changes can be committed. Unstaged changes will stay as modified files on the server. The “git commit” command is the easiest way to go about doing so.  This command launches an editing tool which guides the user through the next steps to commit your files. When the user exits the editor tool, Git creates the commit file with the user’s commit message. Instead of that route, a file can be committed with a “git commit –m” message, which can be more specifically targeted.</p>
